# How am I Sleeping

Let me give you a little bit of a back story. Before I was working with Xamarin, I came from the e-health Industry. In particular I spent a lot of time travelling Australia talking e-health, designing e-health solutions and getting across the standards that industry used. Malaysia and Boston were also on the list of the countries that I visited and/or sold solutions too. I also spent time as a committee member on the Medical Software Industry Association group. 

It was fun, it was challenging to say the least. I would often see that there was a shift with mobile that others who were bound to the old ways of thinking were tied to. This is why I left to persue mobile because I saw what it could become, and it has to some degree but there is more that can be done. 

But part of this mobile shift was seeing that every person could be in charge of their own wellness to a certain extent and over several years I have setup projects to analyse that information and collate them in ways that could be used to help the health system as a whole. Part of that is being able to collect information from a variety of devices such as digital scales, blood pressure monitors, sleep sensors and other recording devices connected to services like Apple HealthKit and Google Fit. 

One of the sensors that I have is was the Sense Pill, from the Hello team. Unfortunatly the Hello company that makes that product is no longer in business, and this being my favorite of all of them is no longer available. 

I had been looking for an alternative for a while when I watched a video from Wilderness Labs and realised that I could use their framework to make an equivilant and then be able to record the information that I want and then store that information. I am not really much of a hardware developer, but the framework has inspired me to do some work with it. I have a couple of Netduino's handy and I'm going to get the parts that I need and start development with it. 

The capabilities that I want to add to the project for the first push are:
* Abient Light Detection
* Decibel noise levels
* Tempurature Levels
* Humidity Levels
* Audio Playbacks of modern sounds (whales, white noise, etc)
* LED lighting to provide feedback
* Web integration so a mobile app can get the details and send controls
* Smart Alarms for the application

Like most of my projects, it will fit in around the other work I do, but feel free to keep a watch and see the updates as they come through. It should be fun
